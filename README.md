## Fake News Detection

In this project, I have used various natural language processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to classify fake news articles using sci-kit libraries from python.


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

# Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

1.\ Python 3 :


1.1\ This setup requires that your machine has python 3.6 installed on it. you can refer to this url https://www.python.org/downloads/ to download python. Once you have python downloaded and installed, you will need to setup PATH variables (if you want to run python program directly, detail instructions are below in how to run software section). To do that check this: https://www.pythoncentral.io/add-python-to-path-python-is-not-recognized-as-an-internal-or-external-command/.
    
1.2\ Setting up PATH variable is optional as you can also run program without it and more instruction are given below on this topic.


2.\ Second and easier option is to download anaconda and use its anaconda prompt to run the commands. To install anaconda check this url https://www.anaconda.com/download/

3.\ You will also need to download and install below 3 packages after you install either python or anaconda from the steps above

3.1   Sklearn (scikit-learn)


3.2   numpy


3.3   scipy

RMQ </> 

*if you have chosen to install python 3.6 then run below commands in command prompt/terminal to install these packages



        pip install -U scikit-learn
        pip install numpy
        pip install scipy

*if you have chosen to install anaconda then run below commands in anaconda prompt to install these packages


        conda install -c scikit-learn
        conda install -c anaconda numpy
        conda install -c anaconda scipy
